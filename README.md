# PHP no-framework back-end

This's a simple and extendable back-end for an e-commerce website made with Vanilla PHP, a custom-made Router and relational database, and a dynamic way of adding new product types and new type properties through API endpoints.  

## Installation

Use the command `php -S localhost:8080` to run the service once the apache server is running and the Mysql one as well. 


## About
This project was a test task for the junior PHP developer position at [Scandiweb](https://scandiweb.com/).
As per the instructions, the project was written with vanilla PHP, custom `Router`, uses OOP principles to implement the application logic, which was used to implement the Custom `QueryBuilder`. 

The application serves the `index.php` file, which defines the routing rules, methods, and middleware.
