# PHP no-framework back-end

This's a simple and extendable back-end for an e-commerce website made with Vanilla PHP, a custom-made Router and relational database, and a dynamic way of adding new product types and new type properties through API endpoints.  

## Installation

Use the command `php -S localhost:8080` to run the service once the apache server is running and the Mysql one as well.
